# Knowledge Reset: Technical Specification

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 16, 2026  
**Author:** Manus AI

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the technical specification for **Knowledge Reset**, the global knowledge repository that serves as the central brain for the entire Digital Reset ecosystem. Its purpose is to hold all documentation, knowledge bases, instructions, manuals, project documentation, customizations, and internal knowledge generated by both Digital Reset and its customers. 

Knowledge Reset is not a standalone product but a foundational platform that powers all other systems, including the **Reset Platform** and the **Digital Reset OS**. It is designed for deep integration, providing a single source of truth that enhances the intelligence and performance of all connected applications while maintaining strict tenant separation and data privacy.

## 2. Platform Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

Knowledge Reset is architected as a headless, API-first platform. It consists of a robust data ingestion pipeline, a secure multi-tenant data store, and a powerful query engine accessible via a GraphQL API. The platform is designed for high availability, scalability, and low-latency data retrieval.

### 2.2 Core Components

*   **Data Ingestion Engine**: A flexible pipeline that can ingest data from multiple sources, including web crawlers, file uploads (documents, images, voice notes), and direct API calls from other Digital Reset platforms.
*   **Multi-Tenant Data Store**: A secure database that stores all knowledge, with a strict tenant separation model to ensure data privacy.
*   **AI-Powered Query Engine**: A sophisticated search and retrieval engine that uses AI to understand natural language queries and provide accurate, source-cited answers.
*   **GraphQL API**: A unified API that provides a single point of access for all other applications to interact with Knowledge Reset.

## 3. Core Capabilities

*   **Centralized Knowledge Consolidation**: A single repository for all organizational and project-specific knowledge.
*   **Automated Content Acquisition**: A web crawler for ingesting knowledge from public URLs and a multi-modal ingestion engine for files and other data formats.
*   **Conversational AI Interface**: An expert-facing chat interface that allows domain specialists to feed and correct knowledge through natural language conversation.
*   **Intelligent Retrieval**: AI-powered search that understands user intent and provides precise, context-aware answers with citations to the source documents.
*   **Robust APIs for Integration**: A comprehensive GraphQL API that allows for deep integration with all other Digital Reset platforms.

## 4. Technical Stack

| Component | Technology | Justification |
|---|---|---|
| **AI Development Agent** | Google Antigravity | For building the sophisticated AI models that power the query engine and conversational interface. |
| **Deployment** | Vercel | For hosting the API and any associated webhooks or serverless functions. |
| **Database** | Supabase (Postgres with pgvector) | Provides a scalable, secure, and cost-effective solution for storing large volumes of text and vector data. |
| **Backend Language** | Python | The extensive ecosystem of AI and data processing libraries makes Python the ideal choice for the backend. |
| **API** | GraphQL | Provides a flexible and efficient way for client applications to query and manipulate data. |

## 5. AI API Strategy

Knowledge Reset's AI strategy is focused on accuracy, context retention, and the ability to handle long, complex conversations. The following AI APIs are recommended:

| Use Case | Primary AI API | Secondary/Fallback | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Conversational Knowledge Ingestion** | Claude Opus 4.5 | Gemini 3 Pro | Essential for maintaining context in long conversations with domain experts. |
| **Natural Language Query Processing** | GPT-5.2 | Claude Opus 4.5 | The lowest hallucination rate and superior reasoning capabilities are critical for providing accurate answers. |
| **Data Extraction from Documents** | Gemini 3 Pro | GPT-5.2 | The 1M token context window is ideal for processing large documents and multi-modal data. |

## 6. Security and Compliance

As the central repository for all company and customer data, Knowledge Reset will adhere to the most stringent security and compliance standards:

*   **SOC 1 and SOC 2**
*   **ISO 22301, ISO/IEC 20000, ISO 9001**
*   **ISO/IEC 27018, ISO/IEC 27017, ISO/IEC 27701, ISO/IEC 27001**
*   **GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, CCPA**
*   **Certified Senders Alliance (CSA)**

## 7. Data Architecture

### 7.1 Tenant Separation

Tenant separation is the most critical aspect of the Knowledge Reset data architecture. A multi-layered approach will be used to ensure that no customer data is ever exposed to another customer:

*   **Database-Level Separation**: Each tenant will have their own dedicated schema in the Supabase database.
*   **Application-Level Separation**: All API requests will be authenticated and authorized to ensure that users can only access data from their own tenant.
*   **AI Model Separation**: While AI models will be trained on aggregated and anonymized data, no tenant-specific data will be used for training without explicit consent.

### 7.2 Data Privacy and Anonymization

While customer-specific data (e.g., project details, personal information) will be strictly isolated, the solutions and knowledge generated from support requests and other interactions will be anonymized and added to a global knowledge base. This will allow the AI to learn from every interaction and improve its performance across all tenants without compromising data privacy.

## 8. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)


| KPI | Target | Measurement |
|---|---|---|
| **Query Accuracy** | > 98% | Measured by the percentage of queries that return the correct and relevant information. |
| **Context Retention in Conversations** | < 0.5% error rate | Measured by the number of times the AI loses context in a long conversation. |
| **Data Ingestion Speed** | < 5 minutes | Average time to ingest and index a new document. |
| **API Response Time** | < 200ms | Average latency for all API requests. |
| **Platform Uptime** | 99.999% | Monitored via automated tools. |
